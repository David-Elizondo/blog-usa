title: "Modernize your pipeline to be ARM-ready with multi-arch container builds"
---

# Where this work happens
Set up the article by talking about pipelines in general.. A few lines about why pipelines are a thing, and who this article is targeted at.  Discuss production and artifacts and lay out the ground work for understanding.

# Why this work happens
Convince reader to go for multiarch (lens of developer / devops) - talk future proofing, cost savings, cool tech, etc... keep it short, this is not a business pitch but rather, why you as a developer should invest your time in this technology

# What are the steps
Actual steps to do the work here (gitlab pipeline) - briefly touch on this and that between jenkins, gitlab, github, circle ci, etc...

# A peek under the hood
Talk about multi-arch in the pipeline, vs local, vs with jenkins, using buildx, discuss separate runners, get technical here if you want

# Small conclusion and ippon buisness pitch
